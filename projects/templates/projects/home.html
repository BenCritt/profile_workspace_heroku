Python is a tool I particularly enjoy using, both for the fun of creating interesting projects as well as for its ability to increase productivity.

Prior to teaching, I worked in IT support for a department at my alma mater, UW-Madison.

I've also included on this website a link to my GitHub account, on the "Contact Me" page and in the footer.
