Python is a tool I particularly enjoy using, both for the fun of creating interesting projects as well as for its ability to increase productivity.  Working with technology is something I find as fun as much as I find it important.</div>

I also have seven years of teaching experience at the secondary level, as well as three years of experience as a substitute teacher across the K-12 system prior to becoming a full-time teacher.  Prior to teaching, I worked in IT support for a department at my alma mater, UW-Madison.  My experience as a teacher has taught me organizational and communication skills that, coupled with my technical skills, enables me to be an asset for any organization with IT support needs.</div>

It's hosted on a Heroku server with a domain name through Cloudflare.  As a demonstration of my technical knowledge, I've included some programs on this website.  I created these programs using the Python programming language.  I've shared the source code for these programs in GitHub repositories, linked on the bottom of their respective web pages.  I've also included on this website a link to my GitHub account, on the "Contact Me" page and in the footer.  There, you will find more repositories demonstrating my coding ability, including the source code for this website.</div>
