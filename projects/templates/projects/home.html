            <div class="accordion-body"><strong>My professional interests are IT Services, Software Development, and Data Analytics.</strong>  My name is Ben Crittenden, and I have a passion for developing and deploying technology that enables people to be more productive in their work and to have more meaningful experiences in their lives.  Python is a tool I particularly enjoy using, both for the fun of creating interesting projects as well as for its ability to increase productivity.  Working with technology is something I find as fun as much as I find it important.</div>

Prior to teaching, I worked in IT support for a department at my alma mater, UW-Madison.  My experience as a teacher has taught me organizational and communication skills that, coupled with my technical skills, enables me to be an asset for any organization with IT support needs.</div>

It's hosted on a Heroku server with a domain name through Cloudflare.  As a demonstration of my technical knowledge, I've included some programs on this website.  I created these programs using the Python programming language.  I've shared the source code for these programs in GitHub repositories, linked on the bottom of their webpages.  I've also included on this website a link to my GitHub account, on the "Contact Me" page.  There, you will find more repositories demonstrating my coding ability, including the source code for this website.</div>
