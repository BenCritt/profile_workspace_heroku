As a demonstration of my technical knowledge, I've included a QR code generator on this website.  I created this program using the Python programming language.  Python is a tool I enjoy using, both for the fun of creating interesting projects as well as for its ability to increase productivity.  I've also included on this website a link to a GitHub repository containing the source code for some of my projects.  The GitHub repository linked here is not the repository I use for this website; it's just a way for me to share examples of what I've created.</div>
