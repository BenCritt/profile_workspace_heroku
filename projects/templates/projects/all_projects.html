Ideal for data analysts, financial planners, and decision-makers, the Monte Carlo Simulator provides valuable insights into risk and uncertainty. With its user-friendly interface, you can quickly set up single or dual simulations by defining parameters such as the number of simulations, minimum and maximum values, and target values. The app then generates probability graphs and saves them as PDFs, making it easy to visualize and share the results.</p>
